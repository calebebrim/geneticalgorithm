# Genetic Algotithm Experiments


Documentation for Genetic Algorithm : 
- GA
- GAU

GAU is the defaut functions used on "GA.__init__". Only modify if you are confident what are you doing.



## Usage:

To run the examples you must use python module notation: 
python -m src.path.to.filename

### Example 1 - Maximization:


Sum 2 numbers, genetich will optimize those numbers to get highest sum.

    
    python -m src.example.sum_maximization
    
or 

    
    make maximization
    
### Example 2 - Minimization: 
Sum 2 numbers, genetich will optimize those numbers to get lowest sum.
    
    python -m example.sum_minimization

or

    make minimization
### Example 2 - Using Threads:
Sum 2 numbers, genetich will optimize those numbers to get highest sum. 
This will use threads, IDK what it is so slow so help me if you have some sugestion about how to implement it wisely. 

I think that it should be used only when your fitness function takes too much to run.

    python -m src.example.sum_paralel.py
